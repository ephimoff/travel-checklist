## Notes and tips

- [Stuff that you're not allowed to bring on a plane](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring). Consider sending it via package courier or freight train
- Pack everything in clear plastic bags (preferably zip lock), divided into items e.g. underwear, t-shirts, shorts etc. before packing in your suitcase or backpack. One plastic bag for each type of clothing.
- If you want to make sure everything else in your bags stays clean and odor free, place the shoes inside old socks and then inside airtight plastic bags (ziplock)
- Keep any medication and important papers in your carry-on bag. On long flights with multiple stopovers, packing a fresh change of clothes is a good idea as bags tend to get delayed or lost on long haul, multiple stop flights.
- Roll your closthes or cube it, don't fold
- Make sure your light coloured clothes are packed inside out
- Hold on to hotel disposable shower caps and use them to cover the base of your shoes.
